        <h2>Makeup in Props and Cosplay</h2>
        <p>
          Makeup plays a crucial role in bringing characters to life in cosplay and stage performance. It enhances facial features, adds realism, and helps transform the performer into the desired character. There are various types of makeup and techniques, depending on the complexity of the look.

          <h3>Basic Character Makeup</h3>
          <p>
            This includes everyday makeup techniques adjusted to match a character's appearance — such as contouring to mimic facial structure, bold eyeshadow for anime looks, or using foundation to match a character’s skin tone. 
            Tools include brushes, sponges, primers, foundation, eyeliner, and setting spray. It’s often subtle but essential for enhancing your look under bright lights or cameras.
          </p>

        <section class="subpg" id="subpg2">
          <h3>Special Effects (SFX) Makeup</h3>
          <p>
            SFX makeup involves creating more dramatic effects such as scars, wounds, aging, fantasy skin textures, or monster features. It often uses prosthetics, latex, silicone, and special adhesives. 
            Tools include sculpting tools, liquid latex, spirit gum, fake blood, grease paints, and sealing sprays. SFX requires more advanced skills but adds incredible realism for horror, fantasy, or sci-fi characters.
          </p>
        </section>

          <section class="subpg" id="subpg3">
            <h3>Body & Face Paint</h3>
            <p>
              Body and face paints are used when a character has non-human skin tones (like blue, green, red, etc.) or body markings. High-quality, skin-safe paints are applied using sponges, airbrushes, or brushes.
              Products include water-based, alcohol-based, or grease-based paints. Setting powder or spray is used to prevent smudging. This is essential for full-body characters like demons, aliens, or mythical creatures.

      <section class="page" id="page2">
        <p>
          Props are typically made from three main materials: <strong>wood</strong>, <strong>EVA foam</strong>, and <strong>plastic</strong>. 
          <!-- strong makes the word bolded i used it here cause i wnat them to stand out -->
          Each material requires different tools and skills, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages.
        </p>

          <li><button id="subpage6btn">Plastic</button></li>
        </ul>

        <section class="subpg" id="subpg4">
          <h3>Wood</h3>
          <p>
            Wood is the most difficult material to work with due to the need for advanced tools such as saws, sanders, drills, and sometimes even carving tools. 
            It requires knowledge of woodworking techniques and safety precautions. However, its natural strength and rigidity make it ideal for props that 
            must be durable and long-lasting — for example, swords, shields, or large structure props. It also holds paint well and can be stained or weathered for realistic effects.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="subpg" id="subpg5">
          <h3>EVA Foam</h3>
          <p>
            EVA foam is a lightweight, affordable, and flexible material, widely used in cosplay and prop-making. It can be easily cut with a utility knife 
            and shaped with heat tools like a heat gun. Gluing, sanding, and sealing are essential steps in the process. 
            It’s especially good for making armor pieces and wearable props, as it’s soft and comfortable to wear. 
            While not the most durable, it can be reinforced with coatings like Plasti Dip or resin.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="subpg" id="subpg6">
          <h3>Plastic</h3>
          <p>
            Plastic is commonly used through 3D printing with materials like PLA or ABS. It is relatively easy to learn if you're familiar with 3D modeling software 
            and slicing tools. Once printed, props may require sanding, priming, and painting. Plastic prints are strong and suitable for both functional and decorative props. 
            However, they can be bulky and heavy, and post-processing takes time. Still, plastic allows for high precision and intricate details.
          </p>

      </section>

      <section class="page" id="page3">
        <p>
          Creating props involves more than just choosing a material. It’s a multi-step process that takes your idea from concept to a fully finished piece. 
          Understanding each stage helps with planning, budgeting, and producing higher-quality results.

        <section class="subpg" id="subpg7">
          <h4>1. Planning & Design</h4>
          <p>
            Every prop starts with a concept. This may involve gathering reference images, drawing blueprints or sketches, and choosing the most suitable material.
            At this stage, measurements, proportions, and the overall function (static or wearable) are decided. Digital design tools like Blender, Fusion 360, or Photoshop are often used.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="subpg" id="subpg8">
          <h4>2. Cutting & Shaping</h4>
          <p>
            Once your design is finalized, the next step is cutting the materials into the required shapes. This might involve using utility knives (for EVA foam), jigsaws or Dremels (for wood), or slicing software (for 3D printing).
            Heat shaping and beveling also occur at this stage to prepare the parts for assembly.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="subpg" id="subpg9">
          <h4>3. Assembly & Detailing</h4>
          <p>
            After shaping, parts are glued, screwed, or printed together. This is where your prop starts to take form. 
            Details like engraving, weathering, raised patterns, or adding faux hardware can dramatically improve realism.
            Depending on material, adhesives like contact cement, wood glue, or epoxy may be used.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="subpg" id="subpg10">
          <h4>4. Painting & Finishing</h4>
          <p>
            The final step involves sanding surfaces smooth, priming, and painting. Base coats are applied first, followed by shading, dry-brushing, or weathering for realism.
            Sealants or clear coats protect the finish and improve durability. For wearable props, comfort lining or straps might also be added here.
